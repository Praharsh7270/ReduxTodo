# React + Vite - Todo Website

This project is a **Todo Website** built using **React** and **Vite**, with state management handled by **Redux Toolkit**. It provides a minimal setup with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete todos
- Mark todos as completed
- Persist state using Redux Toolkit
- Fast performance with Vite
- ESLint integration for better code quality

## Plugins Used
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enabling type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
